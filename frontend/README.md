# Contact List

This project is about a contact list in which we can see our contacts information, search, and see the 4 top contacts we communicate with more than others. The technologies I've used in the project are redux and redux-thunk to store data, react-router for navigating between pages, etc. I've used [Atlaskit](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/) as a ui-library for designing our widgets and icons.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
